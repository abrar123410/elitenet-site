      <h2>What is LAN?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> connects computers and devices in a small geographic area like a home, office, or school. It allows devices to share resources such as files, printers, and internet connections quickly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High-speed connections (usually 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps)</li>
        <li>Limited to a small area</li>
        <li>Lower cost to set up and maintain</li>
        <li>Commonly uses Ethernet or Wi-Fi</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is WAN?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong> connects multiple LANs over large distances, such as cities, countries, or even globally. The Internet is the largest example of a WAN.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower speeds compared to LAN (varies widely)</li>
        <li>Covers large geographical areas</li>
        <li>Higher cost and complex setup</li>
        <li>Uses technologies like MPLS, leased lines, or VPNs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advantages of LAN</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast data transfer</li>
        <li>Easy to set up</li>
        <li>Cost-effective for small networks</li>
        <li>Better security control</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Advantages of WAN</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Connects multiple locations globally</li>
        <li>Supports remote work and communication</li>
        <li>Enables cloud services and internet access</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>LAN and WAN serve different purposes: LAN is perfect for local, high-speed connections, while WAN is essential for connecting networks across large distances. Choosing the right network depends on your scale, speed needs, and budget.</p>
