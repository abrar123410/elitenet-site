      <h2>What is an IP Address?</h2>
      <p>An <strong>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)</strong> is a unique identifier assigned to every device on a network. It enables devices to locate and communicate with each other.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifies devices on a network</li>
        <li>Facilitates data transmission between devices</li>
        <li>Essential for both LAN and WAN communication</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Types of IP Addresses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Static IP:</strong> Manually assigned and remains constant over time. Useful for servers, printers, or devices needing a fixed address.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic IP:</strong> Automatically assigned by a DHCP server. Can change periodically. Commonly used for personal devices and home networks.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

            <td>Use Case</td>

            <td>Cost/Management</td>
            <td>Requires manual setup, more maintenance</td>
            <td>Easy to manage, no manual configuration</td>

    <section>
      <h2>How IP Addressing Works</h2>
      <p>Devices communicate over a network by sending data packets containing the destination IP address. Routers and switches use these IPs to route traffic correctly between devices and networks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Understanding IP addressing is essential for network configuration. Static IPs are best for devices that require a fixed address, while dynamic IPs are ideal for most everyday devices for simplicity and flexibility.</p>
