      <h2>What is a Router?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Router</strong> connects multiple networks together, directing data packets between them and managing internet traffic. Routers are essential for connecting LANs to the internet or other external networks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connects different networks (LAN to WAN)</li>
        <li>Manages IP addresses and routing tables</li>
        <li>Often includes firewall and NAT features</li>
        <li>Examples: Home Wi-Fi router, Enterprise router</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What is a Switch?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Switch</strong> connects multiple devices within a LAN and directs data efficiently between them. Switches operate at the data link layer to manage internal network traffic.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connects devices within a LAN</li>
        <li>Manages internal data traffic efficiently</li>
        <li>Can be managed (advanced features) or unmanaged</li>
        <li>Examples: Office Ethernet switch, PoE switch</li>
      </ul>

          <tr>
            <td>IP Assignment</td>
            <td>Yes, often assigns IP addresses (DHCP)</td>
            <td>No, works at MAC address level</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Examples</td>
            <td>Home/Enterprise Router</td>
            <td>Ethernet/PoE Switch</td>

      <h2>Advantages of Routers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows multiple networks to communicate</li>
        <li>Provides internet access for LAN devices</li>
        <li>Includes security features like NAT and firewall</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Advantages of Switches</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Efficiently manages internal LAN traffic</li>
        <li>Supports multiple devices on the same network</li>
        <li>Can improve LAN performance with managed switches</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Routers and switches serve complementary roles in networking. Routers connect networks and handle internet traffic, while switches connect devices within a LAN for efficient data transfer. Choosing the right device depends on your network scale and requirements.</p>
