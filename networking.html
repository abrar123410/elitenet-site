      <h2>1. What is a Network?</h2>
      <p>A network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources like files, internet, and printers. Networks can be as small as two devices or span across the globe.</p>

      <h2>2. LAN vs WAN</h2>
      <p><strong>LAN (Local Area Network)</strong> connects devices within a small area like a home or office. <strong>WAN (Wide Area Network)</strong> spans large geographical regions — like the internet. <a href="lan-vs-wan.html">Learn more about LAN vs WAN →</a></p>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Routers and Switches</h2>
      <p><strong>Routers</strong> connect different networks and handle internet traffic, while <strong>switches</strong> connect multiple devices within a LAN and manage internal data traffic. <a href="routers-switches.html">Read more on Routers & Switches →</a></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. IP Addressing</h2>
      <p>Every device on a network gets an <strong>IP address</strong>—a unique identifier for communication. There are static and dynamic IPs. <a href="ip-addressing.html">Understand IP Addressing →</a></p>
